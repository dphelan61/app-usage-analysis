    "# Analysis of Average Installs per Genre (Apple App Store)\n",
    "\n",
    "From looking at the above average installs per genre in the App Store, it looks like Navigation apps have the most user ratings. Although this could indicate that Navigation apps could be home to some of the most downloaded apps, I assume the higher user ratings just has to do with more folks being vocal about an app they more consistently use. I could see if, for instance, Apple Maps unfortunately not getting that much love. In fact, from checking the App Store now, I see that Apple Maps actually has no user ratings, which I find hard to believe as everyone should have the app on their phone, and I can't be the only one that was taken to the back entrance of where I was supposed to go when I used the app. From looking at Google Maps and Waze, I see 1.5 million reviews for each app, and they're both sitting comfortably at 5 stars. From this, I think the Navigation space would be hard to break into along with the next most rated genres of Social Networking, Music, and Weather for similar reasons. The \"Reference\" genre looks promising at first until you see that the Bible app and Dictionary.com are the Facebook and Google Maps of this genre as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the medium-level amount of user reviews, we have the following (in no particular order):\n",
    "- Finance\n",
    "- Travel\n",
    "- Shopping\n",
    "- Productivity\n",
    "- Food & Drink\n",
    "- Games\n",
    "- Photo & Video\n",
    "- News\n",
    "- Sports\n",
    "\n",
    "From looking at the above categories, I think the Finance genre also has some well-established apps that are owned by established banks. The same goes for Shopping, Food & Drink, News, Sports and Photo & Video with well-established companies having their information shared in app form. This then brings us full circle to the Games category - there may be a few heavy hitters like Angry Birds out there, but the space is more open for a small app to catch on. Travel and Productivity could also be looked into further."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "When looking through our datasets to see which genre of free and English-only apps we should be developing based on what is already heavily downloaded, it's tempting to just develop what has the most downloads or is the most reviewed. However, as we saw with the Social Media and Navigation categories, there can be a few categories with a lot of downloads thanks to one or two apps that are not going anywhere anytime soon. As a result, it would be better to go into a popular category where it's possible to make a variety of apps that have a chance of catching an audience. We narrowed down our categories to ones which meet this criteria, and taking personal interest and experience into account with Games, it would be easier to churn out different games that can help people pass time and maybe let our developers have some fun making them."
